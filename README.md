# USA Mass Shootings and Gun Violence
Project by: SM Mashuque, Anastasia Okoye, and Kelly Yu

## Description of Data
We utilized two datasets from Kaggle.com for our project. The datasets are described below.

Dataset 1:​ ​https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data

This dataset provided a comprehensive record of over 200,000 gun violence incidents in the United States from 2013 to 2018. It reported detailed information about each individual incident, such as the date, address, number killed/injured, longitude and latitude of the location of the incident.

Dataset 2:​ ​https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/us-mass-shootings-last-50-years

The second dataset provided information about mass shootings that occurred in the United States from 1966-2017 . Similar to the gun violence dataset, this dataset provided detailed statistics about each individual mass shooting incident, such as the location, date, fatalities, injuries, latitude and longitude coordinates of the incident.

## Analysis
For the first graph, we wanted to see if there was a correlation between the number of gun violence incidents and mass shooting incidents by state. We also wanted to see if there were any mass shootings or gun violence trends as the years progressed. The map shows a few interesting trends relating to the number of gun violence incidents and mass shootings per state and year. One can see that the number of mass shootings experiences a sharp increase between 2014 and 2015. The graph also tells us that states with fewer gun violence incidents tend to have little to no mass shooting incidents, especially states in the midwest such as Wyoming, Utah, and North Dakota.

One surprising thing our first visualization reveals is that it appears that more mass shootings appear on the Eastern half of the United States, especially on the East Coast and in the South. Also, there was a larger number of mass shootings recorded in 2015 as compared to other years, so it would be interesting to see if there was anything that could explain this trend. In 2013 and 2014, gun violence data does not appear to correlate with mass shootings, however in 2015 and 2016 there appears to be a slight correlation between the mass shootings and the number of gun violence incidents by state.

In the second graph, we wanted to see if there was a trend in the number of mass shootings that occurred as the years progressed. The map shows that there were few mass shootings in the earlier years, but around the 2000’s the number of mass shootings per year appeared to increase and these incidents occurred more frequently. The map also showed little to no correlation between the location of mass shootings as the years go by. In later years, however, it can be seen that the mass shootings occurred more frequently in the South and East Coast.
